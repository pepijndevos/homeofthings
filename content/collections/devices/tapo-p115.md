Save energy with all devices in your home, thanks to the Tapo P115 Smart Plug. For example, you can ensure that your television is not left on, which would cause you to use unnecessary power. You can operate the plug directly via the app, or you can set a schedule in advance. When you use a schedule, your devices will switch on and off at the same times every day. While you save energy and money, you can see in the app how much energy your devices use every day. This way you know which devices you might be better off turning off and how much you can save with this. The plug is small enough to have another plug next to it.

### Home Assistant integration

These devices are supported by the official [TP-Link Tapo](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tplink_tapo/) integration via a local API, but do require setup via the official app.
