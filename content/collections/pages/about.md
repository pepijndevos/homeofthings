It seems like every time I want to buy a new appliance I spend days researching options that don't live stream my whereabouts onto the internet but provide modern affordances. What if I publish my research, sell products I believe in, and develop new products to fill gaps in the market? The plan:

### Review IoT devices

Record videos and write articles that test and review IoT devices in terms of privacy and reliability. The HoT testing criteria include:

- Does it work locally without any mandatory cloud, app, account, or subscription? Does it keep working when the internet is down or the company goes out of business?
- Does the "dumb" functionality work independently of any smart integration? Does the doorbell still ring if the WiFi is down or my phone is off?
- How easy is it to set up? Will it be automatically detected, or do I need to fiddle for days with unofficial extensions and config files?
- What does their privacy policy say if you do use their cloud service? What do they collect? How is it encrypted? Will they sell it to data brokers? Are they subject to search warrants? Has their code been audited?

### Build an IoT privacy database

I intend to collect my reviews into a searchable database, and take contributions from the community. Together we can take the chore out of finding devices that meet your needs.

I recognize that one person's private home automation is another's privacy nightmare. For some a cloud service is fine if they have a good privacy policy, some just want to keep the data within the house, some want strict access control, and some may want to completely air-gap everything. The HoT database will have you covered.

### Resell good products

With a database of good products in hand, we can help you acquire these products.

Step one is to add affiliate links to shops that sell the product we tested. You get a good product, the merchant gets your business, and we get a small commission for connecting the dots.

Step two is to launch our own webshop to become your one-stop-shop for a private smart home.

### Develop new devices

We'll use income from the shop, the knowledge from the database, and input from the community to identify and develop new IoT devices that fill a gap in the market.

I'm an experienced software and electrical engineer who has launched several products, and I can't wait to turn my DIY hacks into products that normal people can actually use.

### Local IoT becomes the norm

My grand vision for the future is that a local first smart home becomes a reality for everyone. It shouldn't require days of research and fiddling to set up a smart home that respects your privacy. Let's build that future.
